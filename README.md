Look for the file matching your surname. Open your file for editing (text file only). List down ten things about yourself, whether true or not. (However, please use common sense and decency in deciding what to put in.)

After you're done, commit the changes and issue a pull request. Follow the instructions here: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request.
